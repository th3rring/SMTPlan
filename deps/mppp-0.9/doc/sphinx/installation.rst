Installation
============

mp++ is written in modern C++, and it requires a compiler able to understand at least C++11
(mp++ will also use some features from C++14 and C++17, if supported by the compiler). mp++ is known to run
on the following setups:

* GCC 4.8 and later versions on GNU/Linux 32/64-bit,
* Clang 3.8 and later versions on GNU/Linux 64-bit,
* MSVC 2015 and later versions on Windows 32/64-bit,
* Clang 4 and later versions on Windows 32/64-bit (with the ``clang-cl`` driver for MSVC),
* MinGW GCC 6 on Windows 64-bit,
* Clang on OSX 64-bit (Xcode 6.4 and later),
* Intel compiler ICC 17 on GNU/Linux 64-bit (tested only occasionally).

mp++ has been written, tested and benchmarked on x86 processors, but it does not contain any architecture-specific code
and thus it should run on any architecture supported by GMP (as long as a decent C++11 compiler is available).
mp++ does use compiler-specific functionality (e.g., 128-bit `integers <https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc/_005f_005fint128.html>`__
or `intrinsics <https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/hh802933(v=vs.85).aspx>`__ on 64-bit
architectures) for the implementation of fast integer arithmetics. If such functionality is not available, mp++
will fall back to GMP's ``mpn_`` functions.

mp++ has the following dependencies:

* the `GMP <https://gmplib.org/>`__ library, **mandatory** (GMP 5 and later versions are supported,
  the `MPIR <http://mpir.org/>`__ fork of GMP can also be used);
* on Windows only, the `Debug Help <https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/ms679309(v=vs.85).aspx>`__ library,
  **mandatory** (used to enable more informative error messages). The ``DbgHelp`` library is typically included in the operating system;
* the `GNU MPFR <http://www.mpfr.org>`__ multiprecision floating-point library, *optional*, used in the implementation
  of the :cpp:class:`~mppp::real` class and for providing support for the ``long double`` type (MPFR 3 or a later version is required);
* the `quadmath library <https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/libquadmath/>`__ from GCC, *optional*, used
  in the implementation of the :cpp:class:`~mppp::real128` class (typically, the quadmath library
  is part of GCC and it does not need to be installed separately);
* the `Boost <http://www.boost.org/>`__ and `FLINT <http://flintlib.org/>`__ libraries, *optional*, currently used
  only in the benchmarking suite.

Additionally, `CMake <https://cmake.org/>`__ is the build system used by mp++ and it must also be available when
installing from source (the minimum required version is 3.3).

Installation from source
------------------------

Source releases of mp++ can be downloaded from `github <https://github.com/bluescarni/mppp/releases>`__. Once in the source tree
of mp++, you can use ``cmake`` to configure the build to your liking (e.g., enabling optional features, customizing the installation
path, etc.). The available configuration options are:

* ``MPPP_WITH_MPFR``: enable features relying on the GNU MPFR library (off by default),
* ``MPPP_WITH_QUADMATH``: enable features relying on the quadmath library (off by default),
* ``MPPP_BUILD_TESTS``: build the test suite (off by default),
* ``MPPP_BUILD_BENCHMARKS``: build the benchmarking suite (off by default).

Note that the ``MPPP_WITH_QUADMATH`` option, at this time, is available only using GCC (all the supported versions) and Clang
(since version 3.9). When using Clang, it is still necessary to link to the quadmath library from GCC.

Since mp++ is a header-only library (although with compiled dependencies), there's no compilation step, unless the tests or the benchmarks are being built,
and the installation of mp++ via ``make install`` or similar will just configure and copy the headers to your ``CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX``,
in the ``include`` subdirectory.

Installation via conda
----------------------

.. versionadded:: 0.2

mp++ is available in the `conda <https://conda.io/docs/>`__ package manager from the
`conda-forge <https://conda-forge.org/>`__ channel. Packages for Linux 64-bit, Windows 32/64-bit
and OSX 64-bit are available. In order to install mp++ via conda, you just need to add ``conda-forge`` to the channels:

.. code-block:: bash

   conda config --add channels conda-forge
   conda install mppp

(note that the `conda package <https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/mppp>`__ for mp++ is named ``mppp`` rather than ``mp++``)

Please refer to the `conda documentation <https://conda.io/docs/>`__ for instructions on how to setup and manage
your conda installation.

Checking the installation
-------------------------

You can test the installation of mp++ with the following simple ``main.cpp`` program:

.. code-block:: c++

   #include <iostream>
   #include <mp++/mp++.hpp>

   using int_t = mppp::integer<1>;

   int main()
   {
       int_t n{42};
       std::cout << n << '\n';
   }

If mp++ is installed in a standard prefix, on a typical GNU/Linux system you can compile this example with the following command:

.. code-block:: console

   $ g++ -std=c++11 main.cpp -lgmp

.. note::

   The ``-std=c++11`` flag is not necessary if your GCC version is recent enough (i.e., for GCC 6 and later).

If you installed mp++ with optional features enabled, you will need to link the required libraries as well. For instance,
if both MPFR and quadmath support are enabled, the compilation command on a modern GNU/Linux system will be something like:

.. code-block:: console

   $ g++ -std=c++11 main.cpp -lquadmath -lmpfr -lgmp

.. note::

   Unless the definition ``NDEBUG`` is activated at compile time, mp++ runs extensive
   internal debug checks at runtime which carry a large performance penalty. Users are advised
   to always define ``NDEBUG`` when compiling code using mp++ in ``Release`` builds.

The full list of libraries that need to be linked when using mp++ is the following:

* the GMP library (or the MPIR fork), always required (``-lgmp`` on most Unix-like systems);
* on Windows only, the ``DbgHelp`` library, always required;
* the MPFR library, required only if mp++ was configured with the ``MPPP_WITH_MPFR`` option (``-lmpfr`` on most Unix-like systems);
* the quadmath library, required only if mp++ was configured with the ``MPPP_WITH_QUADMATH`` option (``-lquadmath`` with GCC,
  with clang it might be necessary to provide the full path to the library).

If you are using CMake, it's highly recommended to make use of the config-file package provided with mp++ rather
than locating and linking manually the required dependencies (see the next section).

Including mp++ in your project via CMake
----------------------------------------

.. versionadded:: 0.2

As a part of the mp++ installation, a group of CMake files is installed into ``CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX/lib/cmake/mp++``.
This bundle, which is known in the CMake lingo as a `config-file package <https://cmake.org/cmake/help/v3.3/manual/cmake-packages.7.html>`__,
facilitates the detection and use of mp++ from other CMake-based projects. mp++'s config-file package, once loaded, provides
an imported target called ``mp++::mp++`` which encapsulates all the information necessary to use mp++. That is, linking to
``mp++::mp++`` ensures that mp++'s include directories are added to the include path of the compiler, and that the libraries
on which mp++ depends (e.g., GMP) are brought into the link chain.

For instance, a ``CMakeLists.txt`` file for the simple ``main.cpp`` program presented earlier may look like this:

.. code-block:: cmake

   # mp++ needs at least CMake 3.3.
   cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.3.0)

   # The name of our project.
   project(sample_project)

   # Look for an installation of mp++ in the system.
   find_package(mp++ REQUIRED)

   # Create an executable, and link it to the mp++::mp++ imported target.
   # This ensures that, in the compilation of 'main', mp++'s include
   # dirs are added to the include path of the compiler and that mp++'s
   # dependencies (e.g., GMP) are transitively linked to 'main'.
   add_executable(main main.cpp)
   target_link_libraries(main mp++::mp++)

   # This line indicates to your compiler
   # that C++11 is needed for the compilation.
   # Not strictly necessary with a recent-enough compiler.
   set_property(TARGET main PROPERTY CXX_STANDARD 11)
