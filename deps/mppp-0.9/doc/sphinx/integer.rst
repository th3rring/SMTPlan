Multiprecision integers

The ``integer`` class

Types
-----

.. cpp:type:: mp_limb_t

   This type is defined by the GMP library. It is used to represents a limb, that is,
   the part of a multiprecision integer that fits in a single machine word. This is an
   unsigned integral type, typically 64 or 32 bits wide.

.. cpp:type:: mp_bitcnt_t

   This type is defined by the GMP library. It is an unsigned integral type used to count bits in a multiprecision
   number.

Concepts
--------

.. cpp:concept:: template <typename T, typename U> mppp::IntegerOpTypes

   This concept is satisfied if the types ``T`` and ``U`` are suitable for use in the
   generic binary :ref:`operators <integer_operators>` and :ref:`functions <integer_functions>`
   involving :cpp:class:`~mppp::integer`. Specifically, the concept will be ``true`` if either:

   * ``T`` and ``U`` are both :cpp:class:`~mppp::integer` with the same static size ``SSize``, or
   * one type is an :cpp:class:`~mppp::integer` and the other is a :cpp:concept:`~mppp::CppInteroperable` type.

   Note that the modulo, bit-shifting and bitwise logic operators have additional restrictions.

   A corresponding boolean type trait called ``are_integer_op_types`` is also available (even if the compiler does
   not support concepts).

.. cpp:concept:: template <typename T, typename U> mppp::IntegerIntegralOpTypes

   This concept is satisfied if the types ``T`` and ``U`` are suitable for use in the
   generic binary :ref:`operators <integer_operators>` and :ref:`functions <integer_functions>`
   involving :cpp:class:`~mppp::integer` and C++ integral types. Specifically, the concept will be ``true``
   if either:

   * ``T`` and ``U`` are both :cpp:class:`~mppp::integer` with the same static size, or
   * one type is an :cpp:class:`~mppp::integer` and the other is a :cpp:concept:`~mppp::CppIntegralInteroperable` type.

   A corresponding boolean type trait called ``are_integer_integral_op_types`` is also available (even if the compiler does
   not support concepts).

.. cpp:concept:: template <typename T, std::size_t SSize> mppp::IntegerBinarySaveDest

   This concept is satisfied if ``T`` is a type into which the serialised binary representation of an
   :cpp:class:`~mppp::integer` with static size ``SSize`` can be written. In other words, the concept is satisfied if
   an object of type ``T`` can be passed as an argument to one of the :cpp:func:`mppp::integer::binary_save()` overloads.

.. cpp:concept:: template <typename T, std::size_t SSize> mppp::IntegerBinaryLoadSrc

   This concept is satisfied if ``T`` is a type from which the serialised binary representation of an
   :cpp:class:`~mppp::integer` with static size ``SSize`` can be loaded. In other words, the concept is satisfied if
   an object of type ``T`` can be passed as an argument to one of the :cpp:func:`mppp::integer::binary_load()` overloads.

.. _integer_functions:

Functions
---------

Much of the functionality of the :cpp:class:`~mppp::integer` class is exposed via plain functions. These functions
mimic the `GMP API <https://gmplib.org/manual/Integer-Functions.html>`__ where appropriate, but a variety of
convenience/generic overloads is provided as well.

Overloaded operators are provided for convenience. Their interface is generic, and their implementation
is typically built on top of basic :ref:`functions <integer_functions>`.
