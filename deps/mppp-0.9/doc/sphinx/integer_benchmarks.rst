Integer benchmarks
------------------

For each benchmarked library, the timings in the bar charts are split into three parts:

* the ``init`` bar, which accounts for the time needed for the initialisation of the benchmark data,
* the ``operation`` bar, which represents the time needed to actually perform the operation being benchmarked,
* the ``total`` bar, which represents the total runtime of the benchmark.

The intent is to provide a breakdown which measures both the performance of the operation
being benchmarked and the effect of the small value optimisation implemented in mp++ (the latter
tends to have a noticeable impact in the initialisation phase of the benchmarks, which usually involves
the creation of a large number of :cpp:class:`~mppp::integer` objects).

.. _integer_dot_product:

Dot product
^^^^^^^^^^^

This benchmark measures the time needed to compute the dot product of two integer vectors of size
:math:`3\times 10^7` containing randomly-generated values. The multiply-add primitives of each library
are used for the accumulation of the dot product. The benchmark is run in a variety of different setups.

.. _integer1_dot_product_unsigned:

1-limb unsigned integers
........................

In this setup, the integer vectors are initialised with small *non-negative* values, and the final dot product
is less than :math:`2^{64}`. mp++ integers with 1 limb of static size are employed. For this benchmark,
we also include timings for 64-bit (``std::uint64_t``) and 128-bit (``__uint128_t``) integers.

It can be immediately seen how the initialisation cost for the ``mpz_int`` class is much higher than for the other
integer types. This is due to the fact that the GMP API always uses dynamically-allocated memory, even for small values.
The other integer types all employ a small-value optimisation, and thus avoid the performance cost of heap allocation.

In this particular benchmark, mp++ is about 3 times faster than GMP (as measured via the ``mpz_int`` wrapper)
in the ``operation`` portion of the benchmark. mp++ is also faster than ``cpp_int`` and FLINT, albeit by a smaller margin.
With respect to the 64/128-bit hardware integer types, there are x4/x2 slowdowns in the ``operation`` portion of the benchmark.

1-limb signed integers
......................

This setup is almost identical to the :ref:`previous one <integer1_dot_product_unsigned>`, but this time the vectors
are initialised with both positive *and* negative values. For this benchmark, we also include timings for 64-bit (``std::int64_t``)
and 128-bit (``__int128_t``) integers.

The presence of both positive and negative values has a noticeable performance impact with respect to the previous test
for all libraries, both during the initialisation of the vectors and in the ``operation`` part of the benchmark.
This is due to the fact that sign handling in multiprecision computations is typically implemented
with branches, and when positive and negative values are equally likely the effectiveness of the CPU's branch predictor
is much reduced.

The performance advantage of mp++ with respect to the other libraries is retained, albeit by a smaller margin.
With respect to the 64/128-bit hardware integer types, there are x10/x4 slowdowns in the ``operation`` portion of the benchmark.
The worse slowdowns (with respect to the previous unsigned test) are due to the high number of mispredicted
branches in this particular test.

.. _integer2_dot_product_unsigned:

2-limb unsigned integers
........................

This setup is the 2-limb version of the :ref:`1-limb unsigned benchmark <integer1_dot_product_unsigned>`:
the vectors are initialised with larger non-negative values, the final result is less than :math:`2^{128}`, and
mp++ integers with 2 limbs of static size are now employed.

.. figure:: _static/integer2_dot_product_unsigned.png

The benchmark shows that mp++'s specialised arithmetic functions pay off in terms of raw performance in this scenario.

2-limb signed integers

This setup is the signed version of the :ref:`previous benchmark <integer2_dot_product_unsigned>`.

As explained earlier, arithmetic with mixed positive and negative values is more expensive than arithmetic with only
non-negative values.

.. _integer_vec_mul:

Vector multiply-add
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In this benchmark, we first compute the element-wise multiplication of two random vectors of size :math:`3\times 10^7`,
followed by the addition to another random vector of the same size. This workload allows to measure the efficiency
of the multiplication and addition operations (whereas in the dot product benchmark the multiply-add primitives were
employed), and it also increases the pressure on the memory subsystem (due to the need to write into large vectors
instead of accumulating the result into a single scalar).

.. _integer1_vec_mul_unsigned:

1-limb unsigned integers
........................

In this setup, the integer vectors are initialised with small *non-negative* values.
mp++ integers with 1 limb of static size are employed. For this benchmark,
we also include timings for 64-bit (``std::uint64_t``) and 128-bit (``__uint128_t``) integers.

.. figure:: _static/integer1_vec_mul_unsigned.png
   :scale: 50%
   :align: center

This time mp++ is more than 5 times faster than GMP in the ``operation`` portion of the benchmark, while still maintaining
a performance advantage over ``cpp_int`` and FLINT.
The slowdown in the ``operation`` part of the benchmark with respect to 64-bit integers is less than x3, while mp++ performs
similarly to 128-bit integers for this particular test.

1-limb signed integers
........................

In this setup, the vectors are initialised with both positive *and* negative values. For this benchmark, we also include
timings for 64-bit (``std::int64_t``) and 128-bit (``__int128_t``) integers.

.. figure:: _static/integer1_vec_mul_signed.png

We can see again how the introduction of mixed positive and negative values impacts performance negatively with respect
to the :ref:`unsigned setup <integer1_vec_mul_unsigned>`.
With respect to the 64/128-bit hardware integer types, there are x4/x2 slowdowns in the ``operation`` portion of the benchmark.

.. _integer2_vec_mul_unsigned:

2-limb unsigned integers
........................

This setup is the 2-limb version of the :ref:`1-limb unsigned benchmark <integer1_vec_mul_unsigned>`:
the vectors are initialised with larger non-negative values, and
mp++ integers with 2 limbs of static size are now employed.

The benchmark shows again that mp++'s specialised arithmetic functions deliver strong performance.

Vector division
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In this benchmark we compute the element-wise division with remainder of two randomly-generated vectors of
size :math:`3\times 10^7`, followed by the sum of all the values in the quotient vector.

.. _integer1_vec_div_unsigned:

1-limb unsigned integers
........................

In this setup, the integer vectors are initialised with small *non-negative* values.
mp++ integers with 1 limb of static size are employed.

.. figure:: _static/integer1_vec_div_unsigned.png

mp++ and FLINT perform well on this test, and they are about 5 times faster than GMP.

1-limb signed integers
........................

In this setup, the vectors are initialised with both positive *and* negative values.

.. figure:: _static/integer1_vec_div_signed.png
   :scale: 50%
   :align: center

Here we can see FLINT pulling ahead of mp++. FLINT uses a signed integer representation for small values
that allows to avoid branching based on the signs of the operands.
Coupled to the fact that there's no need to do overflow checking during division,
FLINT's implementation has a distinct performance advantage in this specific test.

.. _integer2_vec_div_unsigned:

2-limb unsigned integers

This setup is the 2-limb version of the :ref:`1-limb unsigned benchmark <integer1_vec_div_unsigned>`:

Sorting
^^^^^^^

This benchmark consists of the sorting (via ``std::sort()``) of a randomly-generated vector of :math:`3\times 10^7` integers.

1-limb unsigned integers
........................

In this setup, the integer vector is initialised with small *non-negative* values. mp++ integers with 1 limb of static size are employed.

Here again it can be seen how the small-value optimisation implemented in mp++, ``cpp_int`` and FLINT pays off on large
datasets with respect to plain GMP integers. mp++ shows a modest performance increase with respect to ``cpp_int``
and FLINT.

1-limb signed integers

Left bit shift
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This benchmark consists of the element-wise left bit shifting of a randomly-generated vector of :math:`3\times 10^7` integers.

1-limb unsigned integers
........................

In this setup, the integer vector is initialised with small *non-negative* values, which are then left bit shifted 
by a small random amount (so that the result always fits into a machine word). mp++ integers with 1 limb of static size are employed.
